Allowing contracts to access to the block timestamp is
essentially a redundant feature that renders contracts vul-
nerable to manipulation by adversaries. Typically, block
timestamp is used for two purposes: serving as a deter-
ministic random seed (e.g., in theRun contract) and as a
global timestamp in a distributed network (in [25, 26, 28]).
Using block timestamp as a random seed is not wise since
the entropy is low and the timestamp is easy to manipu-
late.

Timestamp dependence detection. We use a special sym-
bolic variable to represent the block timestamp. Note that
the block timestamp stays constant during the execution.
Thus, given a path condition of a trace, we check if this
symbolic variable is included. A contract is flagged as
timestamp-dependent if any of its traces depends on this
symbolic variable.
