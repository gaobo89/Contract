This occurs when the assumed state of the blockchain is not the blockchains
actual state when a transaction is executed. The order in which transactions
are mined can have adverse effects on the execution of any given transac-
tion. This bug is said to be present in up to %15.8 of all contracts on the
blockchain.

TOD detection. Explorer returns a set of traces and the
corresponding Ether flow for each trace. Our analysis thus
checks if two different traces have different Ether flows. If
a contract has such pairs of traces, Oyente reports it as
a TOD contract.
