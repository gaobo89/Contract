At some point during the development of the contract, its name was changed from
DynamicPyramid into Rubixi. However, programmers forgot to accordingly
change the name of the constructor, which then became a function invokable by
anyone (instead, constructors are run only once when the contract is created).
The DynamicPyramid function sets the owner address; the owner can withdraw
his profit via collectAllFees.
